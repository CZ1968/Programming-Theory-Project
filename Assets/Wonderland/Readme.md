# Wonderlad OOP Demo

A small Unity project demonstrating the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:

- **Abstraction**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

The project includes rotating objects (spheres, cubes, etc.) that share a common abstract base class and override behavior in a polymorphic way. Each object can activate its own “Wonderlad magic”, showcasing how different classes implement the same abstract methods.

Perfect as a clean first commit for GitHub.
